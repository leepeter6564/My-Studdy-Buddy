# My-Studdy-Buddy

My Studdy Buddy is a website that students can use to find other people to study with on a certain subject at a certain time/location.

After making an account with a verified college email address, the student may look at/search other students' posts about studying (which includes information such as time, date, location, and the course).

Students may also make their own posts which will be visible to others.

Users may also indicate that they are interested in or going to a Studdy Buddy event in the post. The list of people who have indicated that they are interested or going to a certain event is visible to all users.

The MySQL Tables are not displayed in this repository.

This project is built upon the foundations of Problem-set (pset) 7 of CS50 Fall 2015.
Code that was given by the pset is indicated as such.
